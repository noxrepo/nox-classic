NOX Network Control Platform v0.2.0
-----------------------------------
Copyright (C) 2008 Nicira Networks

Welcome to the NOX network control platform.   This distribution
includes all the software you need to build, install, and deploy NOX in
your network, as well as source code and tools to allow you to develop
your own NOX applications.

This version of NOX is a developers' release.  It is intended to provide
a programmatic platform for controlling one or more OpenFlow switches.
NOX can be extended both in C++ or Python and provides an abstracted
interface to OpenFlow.  This distribution contains a set of example
applications and some built in libraries which provide useful network
functions such as host tracking and routing.

For detailed installation, development and use instructions, refer to
the NOX manual in docs/manual/build/html.

*Note*

NOX relies on OpenFlow as the communication protocol for controlling
switches.  This build supports Openflow v0x89 experimental.
