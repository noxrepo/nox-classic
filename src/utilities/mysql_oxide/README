mysql-oxide README

mysql-oxide is a hacked-together framework for testing python-based 
analysis apps against a large amount of packet data stored archived
by NOX in the FLOW_SETUP table of the data-warehouse.  

In order to run, mysql-oxide requires a "fake environment" that points to
some dummy libraries, as well as real applications.  You can create this
environment in any directory (e.g., utilities/mysql-oxide) using the 
'make_mysql_oxide_dir.sh' script.  The only parameter that should be
give to this script is the non-relative path to the asena/nox/src
directory.  For example: 

./make_mysql_oxide_dir.sh /home/danwent/asena/nox/src

This creats a 'nox' directory in the current directory that largely
mirrors the asena/nox/src/nox directory, though with a couple key
python files replaced by dummy files.  This directory is made with 
symbolic links, so be careful about changing anything inside of it.  

Then, from the same directory where you ran the above script, run:

python2.5 mysql_oxide.py <module name> <class> 

For example

python2.5 mysql_oxide.py nox.apps.pyapps.ttlbind ttlbind

This will cycle through the FLOW_SETUP table of the data warehouse
and feed each packet recorded there to your application.  mysql_oxide
then calls the timer_callback() method on your application before 
exiting, to let the app print out results. 

This assumes that your data warehouse has data in the FLOW_SETUP table.
If not, use the standard import.py tool along with sql dumps that
can be found at /usr/local/var/nox/export on the machine 'badwater'.  

Note: the default settings assume that the packet_in callback takes an
extra time parameter.  The easiest way to do this is to add a 'time' 
parameter to your packet_in callback with a default value.  For example:

def packet_in_callback(self, dpid, inport, reason, len, bufid, packet, time = 0) :

You can also change the number of packet fed to your app by adding 
"LIMIT X" (where X is the number of packets) to the query string used
by mysql_oxide.  This is helpful for debugging applications.
